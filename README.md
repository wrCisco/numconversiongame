# numconversiongame
Simple Q&amp;R games, mostly hexadecimal arithmetics

Numconversiongame is a very simple platform to sharpen skills with Q&R console based games.
I wrote it mostly to train myself in rapid computations with hexadecimal numbers.

The platform is extensible by subclassing the Game class in games.py and adding an instance
of the subclass to the GAMES list in numconv.py (more info in Game class documentation).
